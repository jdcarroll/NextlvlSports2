							<p>PRESS RELEASE Oct. 2013 Mt. Paran Sports has partnered with Kirk Doyle</p>
					
							<p>Mount Paran North Sports in the East Cobb area is pleased to announce our new partnership with Kirk Doyle to enhance and grow our Baseball Program. Kirk is moving into the area and will be assisting us with our coach and player development. Kirk Doyle has 20 years experience in baseball training, development and organizing programs. He has worked with every age group from the beginner to Professional players. Kirk Doyle and Doyle's NEXTLVL Sports Institute share our belief that through the game of baseball, relationships are built to facilitate the opportunity to share Christ. Baseball has become an international language and we at Mount Paran North Sports have positioned ourselves with this partnership to share Jesus Christ locally, nationally and throughout the world using baseball as the platform. On the local level this partnership allows Mount Paran North Sports to provide year around training to our players and coaches. - David Lewis (Mt. Paran Sports Founder)</p>

							<h2>N.S.I. is a proud Teammate of Global Baseball</h2>
				
							Global Youth Baseball Federation (GYBF) is an international evangelistic 501(c) 3 non profit baseball organization whose purpose since 1997&nbsp;is to evangelize the lost on a global scale. Our platform is unique in that through the game of baseball we can build relationships that will facilitate the opportunity to share Christ. Baseball has become an international language and we have received invitations to countries where others would not have access.<br />	
				
							<h3>Dominican Republic:</h3>
							<p>Through Global Baseball we had an opportunity to travel to the Dominican on another baseball mission trip. Doyle's NEXTLVL was represented by missionary and coach Todd Phillips a Coach from Ft. Payne H.S. Most of the players that went were from Georgia. Todd kept a journal of the daily activities, games &amp; missions. Recap: "I think overall the trip was a major realization of how blessed we are, and that all of the world is not like the United States. We faced amazingly talented baseball players and experienced baseball in a way that many will never see. The Dominicans play all day everyday. Teams and individuals were practicing right after we played them. Even with a different language and culture... the love for&nbsp;the game is everywhere. After every game one of the players or coaches would share a testimony or story with Dominican team through a translator. Baseball is great, but we will not be able to play forever and GOD will always be there for us." - Todd Phillips

							<h2>Another NSI news Article</h2>
				
							<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
